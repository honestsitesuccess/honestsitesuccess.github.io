/* This app allows the user to take a multiple choice quiz on content of your choosing. At a minimum, the application should meet the following requirements:

Lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one. You should use jQuery to move between questions as the user enters their response
Allow the user to input his or her response to each questions with radio buttons for the user to enter their response
When the user answers the last question, the quiz should show his or her overall score
Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll want to store your list of questions in an array. For example: var questions = [{question: "What is the capital of the US", choices: ["Washington DC", "NYC", "Silicon Valley"], correct:0}];
Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5) (Optional)
Let the user know their score so far (Optional)
Let the user know if their previous response was correct (Optional)
Any useful features you can come up with! (Optional)
